## 

## üìù The project has:
- Showcase of hotels by cities, prices, and other filters
- Reserver of destination 
- Login, with JWT verification
- Full Responsive aplication

This project was entirely migrated from vanilla Javascript to `TypeScript` and added others libraries such as `Tailwind and React-Router`.

Incorporating `clean arquitechture` and `SWR` with some complex custom Hooks to easly adapt any API with a minimum refactor of the code-base and the benefit to caching calls to endpoints.

In addition all the routes of the front are protected with `Privates` and `Public` routes using the _guard_ `Angular` pattern and user login with `JWT`.

I built an API with `Express` + `Typescript` + `mongoDB` and deployed first on _Railway_ then _Koyeb_.
